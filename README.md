# Tensorflow_Basic_Learning

This is a repository which records my learning process of Deep Learning by Tensorflow1.1 and Keras2.2. 

It includes Simple Perception, Logistic Regression, Multiple Classification Problems, Multi-Layer perceptron(MLP), etc. And at last, the general template of setting up a DNN by Tensorflow is given.
